# ⚙️ Project Configuration

The project has been configured to use the following tools:

## ESLint

ESLint is a linting tool for JavaScript. By providing specific configuration defined in the`.eslintrc.js` file it prevents developers from making silly mistakes in their code and enforces consistency in the codebase.

[ESLint Configuration Example Code](../.eslintrc.js)

## Prettier

This is a great tool for formatting code. It enforces a consistent code style across your entire codebase. By utilizing the "format on save" feature in your IDE you can automatically format the code based on the configuration provided in the `.prettierrc` file. It will also give you good feedback when something is wrong with the code. If the auto-format doesn't work, something is wrong with the code.

## TypeScript

ESLint is great for catching some of the bugs related to the language, but since JavaScript is a dynamic language ESLint cannot check data that run through the applications, which can lead to bugs, especially on larger projects. That is why TypeScript should be used. It is very useful during large refactors because it reports any issues you might miss otherwise. When refactoring, change the type declaration first, then fix all the TypeScript errors throughout the project and you are done. One thing you should keep in mind is that TypeScript does not protect your application from failing during runtime, it only does type checking during build time, but it increases development confidence drastically anyways.

## Absolute imports

Absolute imports should always be configured and used because it makes it easier to move files around and avoid messy import paths such as `../../../Component`. Wherever you move the file, all the imports will remain intact. Here is how to configure it:

For TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`) projects:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
		"strict": true,
		"baseUrl": ".",
		"paths": {
			"@/*": ["./*"]
		}
	}
```
